We expanded this application in a multicohort-multioccasion (MCMO) study that provides simultaneous multicohort comparisons (crosssectional comparisons of different age cohorts) and longitudinal comparisons of the same children on multiple occasions. There was reasonable support for predictions that reliability, stability, factor structure, and the distinctiveness of the SDQ factors would improve with age (a between-group age cohort comparison) and from 1 year to the next (a longitudinal comparison), and that small gender differences were reasonably stable over age. Consistent with the proposal that children's self-perceptions become more realistic with age, Time 1 (Tl) teacher ratings were more highly correlated with student self-ratings at T2 than T1 and contributed to the prediction of T2 self-concept beyond effects mediated by T1 self-concepts. The results support and expand the surprisingly good support for the multidimensionality of self-concept responses for very young children using this procedure.</div></span>"

Self-esteem was assessed annually from age 12 to 16, and depression was assessed at age 16 and 35. Results from latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that both level and change in self-esteem served as predictors for adult depression. Individuals who entered adolescence with low self-esteem, and/or whose selfesteem declined further during the adolescent years, were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression 2 decades later as adults; this pattern held both for global and domain-specific self-esteem.

They perceived a greater emphasis on performance goals (an emphasis on relative ability and right answers) in middle school than in elementary school. Several interactions emerged between year (fifth grade, sixth grade), and both student level of ability (higher, lower, based on standardized achievement tests) and subject domain (math, English). ᭧ 1997Studies suggest that the transition to middle level schools is associated with a decline in motivation and performance for a number of children (see Eccles &amp; Midgley, 1989, for a review). The assumption is sometimes made that these declines are related to physiological and psychological changes associated with puberty and are inevitable. Eccles and Midgley (1989) challenged that assumption, demonstrating that differences in the classroom environment before and after the transition were related to declines in students' expectancies and values in mathematics (e.g., Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, The research reported in this article was supported by grants from the US Department of Education (R215A00430, R117C80003).

One approach to these issues has been to examine the relations between motivation and cognition over time. In addition, it is likely that students perceptions of the classroom context may play a role in facilitating effective learning. The current study examines these issues from a goal orientation theory perspective using a sample of middle school students (\n",

       "). Data on students' personal motivational beliefs and cognitive strategy use as well as perceptions of the classroom goal structures were gathered using surveys. A longitudinal design was used to examine the research questions. Results suggest that motivation and cognition are reciprocally related over time. In addition, perceptions of classroom context were found to have an explanatory effect over and above the variance explained by prior measures of motivation and cognition. The implications for this work include the notion that student motivation can be enhanced through instruction in cognitive strategy use as well as through alteration of classroom goal structures so that there is a stronger emphasis on tasks and learning rather than on grades or external recognition. A key issue for teachers, parents and administrators alike involves the role of student motivation in the learning process. Most often, we believe that students must</div></span>"

On average, students' efficacy beliefs remained stable and relatively high across the transition. Compared with their elementary school teacher, children reported declines in both perceived teacher mastery and performance goal emphases in middle school. A cross-classified hierarchical linear model was used to estimate the effects of perceived teacher and parent goal emphases during 6th and 7th grades on changes in students' efficacy beliefs. An increase in self-efficacy beliefs from elementary to middle school was predicted by an increase in group-level perceptions of teachers' mastery goal emphasis, even after controlling for parents' goal emphases.

A wide variety of approaches were critically examined that considered the stability of means, individual differences (i.e., test-retest correlations), and factor structures using traditional approaches (e.g., ANOVA and correlations) and structural equation models. Structural equation models based on multiple indicators provided a unified analytic approach for evaluating different aspects of stability and offered important advantages over traditional approaches. We describe a hierarchy of invariances and the nature of interpretations that are justified by different patterns of factor structure invariance associated with each level. We conclude that the assumptions underlying the typical repeated-measures ANOVA approach to testing mean differences in longitudinal data are far more restrictive, less easily tested, and less likely to be met than those in the structural equation modeling approach advocated here, and that the use of ANOVA for this purpose requires a huge leap of faith that can rarely be justified on logical or empirical grounds.

School liking -and school concerns for boys -remained significant predictors of attainment when controlling for conduct problems. The transition to secondary school may represent a window of opportunity for developing interventions aimed at improving both pupil psychological functioning and attainment.Periods of transition are often stressful and can influence short and long-term psychological functioning (West, Sweeting, &amp; Young, 2008).

This transition involves simultaneous changes in school environments, social interactions and academic expectations and involves a degree of anxiety for most pupils (Rice, Frederickson &amp; Seymour, 2011). This transition usually occurs at the age of 11 years and coincides with other biological and social changes associated with the transition from childhood to adolescence. The primary-secondary transition can negatively affect pupils' adjustment in a number of ways, as shown by lower grades, low attendance, increased anxiety and conduct</div></span>"

Parental emotional support was most beneficial, predicting stronger mastery goals, weaker performance-avoidance goals, lower test anxiety, and higher academic achievement than any other type of support. Parental academic support functioned as a double-edged sword, predicting not only stronger mastery goals but also stronger performance-approach goals, stronger performance-avoidance goals, and higher test anxiety. Achievement pressure from teachers had the same predictive relationships but was weaker in strength. Perceived emotional support from teachers was not as effective as that from parents in predicting adolescent motivation achievement; however, perceived academic support from teachers was helpful for adolescents in predicting stronger mastery goals. Support from peers worked as a buffer against maladaptive motivation, predicting weaker performance-avoidance goals and lower test anxiety. Mastery goals mediated the relationship between social support and academic achievement, whereas performance-approach goals and performance-avoidance goals mediated the relationship between social support and test anxiety.

Auto-regressive cross-lagged path analyses were conducted over time, controlling for gender, parental education, and academic grades. Greater engagement in valued activities predicted higher optimism, purpose, and self-esteem over time. Importantly, the results did not support an alternate hypothesis of selection effects, in that adolescents who were better adjusted were not more likely than their peers to engage in valued activities over time. We also found that the longitudinal associations between valued activities and positive adjustment may be due partly to an underlying effect of increased positive mood. Thus, engagement in valued activities appears to be important for adolescent positive adjustment, and may help to foster thriving. Communities, educators, and parents should actively support and encourage adolescents to develop valued activities, and seek to ensure that there are ample opportunities and resources available for them to do so.</div></span>"

       ", SD = .39 at 1 st grade) who were identified as lower achieving in literacy. Accounting for consistencies in measures (from one year prior) and for influences of child's age, gender, IQ, ethnicity and economic adversity on achievement, results indicate that adaptive/effortful control at 1 st grade contributed to both academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade, and reading (but not math) achievement at 3 rd grade. Although academic self-efficacy did not partially mediate the linkage between adaptive/effortful control and achievement, academic self-efficacy beliefs were positively correlated with reading and math. Results support the notion that early efforts to promote children's self-regulatory skills would enhance future academic selfbeliefs and achievement, particularly in literacy. Early childhood education has historically emphasized the preparation of children for the &quot;3 R's of school,&quot; or in more current terminology: literacy and math skills (Freeman &amp; Hatch, 1989). However, there is growing consensus that social and emotional competencies enable children to succeed academically (Duncan et al., 2007;Raver &amp; Knitzer, 2002). Despite such emerging evidence that socioemotional and self-regulatory skills contribute to achievement (Duncan et al., 2007), schools often feel pressured to de-emphasize the development of nonacademic (e.g., socioemotional and attentional) skills in the current era of standards-based accountability. Yet, academic and non-academic development are likely intertwined, and early efforts to promote children's social and emotional learning positively influence their concurrent and future academic success (e.g., Rimm-Kaufman, Fan, Chiu, &amp; You, 2007;Zins, Bloodworth, Weissberg, &amp; Walberg, 2004). Thus, there is little need to partition school readiness skills along academic and non-academic lines as both aspects are important for achievement (Duncan et al., 2007). The present study aims to further explore the linkages in the early elementary grades between a) non-academic self-regulatory skills, b) academic selfefficacy beliefs, and c) academic achievement. Specifically, we hypothesized that adaptive/ effortful control at 1 st grade will contribute to academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade which, in turn, contribute to reading and/or math achievement at 3 rd grade.</div></span>"

The study focused specifically on the moderating effect of change in student ethnic congruence from middle to high school. Results indicate that students experiencing more ethnic incongruence from middle to high school, in particular African American and male students, reported declining feelings of school belonging over time. Moreover, students experiencing ethnic incongruence also had increasing worries about their academic success. These results suggest that the changing school demographics from middle school to high school may negatively impact students' school-related affect, especially if they move to high schools which include fewer students who are ethnically similar to themselves. As they move from childhood to adulthood, adolescents negotiate a variety of transitions (e.g., pubertal onset, changes in peer networks), and it is within this developmental backdrop that students must navigate the middle to high school transition (Eccles, Lord, &amp; Midgley, 1991;Steinberg, 2002).

       " non-Hispanic white girls. Girls' participation in physical activity and their global self-esteem were assessed when they were 9, 11, and 13 years old. Panel regression was used to assess the lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem and the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity, controlling for family socioeconomic status (SES) and girls' body mass index (BMI). Results: A significant lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem was identified. Specifically, higher physical activity at ages 9 and 11 years predicted higher self-esteem at ages 11 and 13 years respectively, controlling for covariates. Positive effects of physical activity on self-esteem were most apparent at age 11 and for girls with higher BMI. No support was gained for the lagged effect of selfesteem on physical activity.Results suggest that participating in physical activity can lead to positive self-esteem among adolescent girls, particularly for younger girls and those at greatest risk of overweight. These findings highlight the necessity of promoting physical activity among adolescent girls as a method of fostering positive self-worth.</div></span>"

In addition, the pattern of relations between academic performance and the variables examined was relatively similar at both times of measurement.

However, effects in the reverse direction were not confirmed. These findings support the notion that peer relationships serve an important function for later self-esteem, consistent with many theoretical tenets of the importance of peers for building a strong identity. Finally, we found long-term relations between adult social constructs and adolescent objective and subjective peer approval as well as self-esteem. Therefore, not only do peer relationships play a role in self-esteem development across adolescence, but they remain impactful throughout adulthood.

       " black girls, aged 9 and 10 years at baseline. Methods: Maturation stage and body mass index (BMI) were assessed annually. Biennially girls completed Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children. Changes were analyzed in the context of race, sexual maturation, BMI, and household income. Longitudinal regression models were used to compare trends with age in global selfworth, physical appearance, and social acceptance. Results: Mean global self-worth showed little change over ages 9 -14 years in blacks (p 5 0.09) but decreased in whites (p &lt; 0.001). Mean physical appearance scores for both races declined between ages 9 and 14 years (blacks, p &lt; 0.001; whites, p &lt; 0.001). Mean social acceptance scores increased for both races between ages 9 and 14 years (blacks, p &lt; 0.001; whites, p &lt; 0.001). For all three scores, these changes differed between blacks and whites changes with age in global self-worth and physical appearance scores. Self-worth, physical appearance, and social acceptance scores decreased with increasing BMI. Decreases in physical appearance and social acceptance scores with increasing BMI were smaller in blacks than in whites (p &lt; 0.05). After adjustment for maturation stage and household income, racial differences in social acceptance scores depended on BMI (p &lt; 0.05) but not on age (p 5 0.08). Conclusions: This article reports the first data on selfesteem scores by age for a large population of black girls aged 9 and 14 years and concludes that self-esteem does not follow the same developmental pattern in black as in white girls. A reason for black girls' higher and more stable self-worth and their greater satisfaction with their physical appearance compared to white girls may be racial differences in attitudes toward physical appearance and obesity.</div></span>"

Multiphase growth models replicate previous research, suggesting significant decline in academic self-concept during middle school but modest growth in social self-concept from 3rd through 7th grade. Next, a new contribution is made to the literature by quantifying the amount of within-subject variability (i.e., &quot;lability&quot;) around these linear self-concept trajectories as a between-subjects characteristic. Self-concept lability was found to associate with a general profile of poorer competence and adjustment and to predict poorer academic and social competence at the end of 7th grade above and beyond level of self-concept. Finally, there was substantial evidence that wave-towave changes in youths' self-concepts correspond to teacher and peer evaluations of youths' competence, that attention to peer feedback may be particularly strong during middle school, and that these relations may be moderated by between-subjects indicators of youths' general adjustment. Overall, findings highlight the utility of methods sensitive to within-subject variation for clarifying the dynamics of youths' self-system development.</div></span>"

       " students was followed from the sixth through the eighth grades. Students' perceptions of teacher support and general self-esteem declined and depressive symptoms increased over the course of middle school. We further found that, for both boys and girls, changes in perceptions of teachers' support reliably predicted changes in both self-esteem and depression. In particular, those students perceiving increasing teacher support showed corresponding decreases in depressive symptoms and increases in self-esteem. Gender differences were found for the initial levels of both perceptions of teacher support and general self-esteem. A competing model was also tested, which gave additional support for pathways of influence from perceptions of teacher support to depression and self-esteem, rather than the reverse. This study underscores the role of teacher support in facilitating students' adjustment to middle school and highlights the importance of using idiographic methodologies in the study of developmental processes. Implications and future directions are discussed. Middle schools are a crucial developmental times serve as confidants, mentors, and friends (Lynch &amp; Cicchetti, 1992).
